## Overview

Entrypoint generator is used for procedural generation of entrypoints.

### Functionality
- Dynamically add, remove, update one or more entrypoints at any point in plugin lifetime
- Generated entrypoints can have accessories
- Generated entrypoints can have multiple actions, each of which can be a command or a view 

For performance reasons, the entrypoints are generated once and stored for later use instead of being generated each time when main window is opened.
This means that after initial generator run the only way to add, delete or remove generated entrypoint is based on some external event e.g. file change

### Plugin Manifest

To use entrypoint generator, entrypoint with type `"entrypoint-generator"` is required

#### Example
```toml
[[entrypoint]]
id = 'main'
name = 'Main'
path = 'src/main.tsx'
type = 'entrypoint-generator'
description = 'Description of a entrypoint generator'
```

## Note on usage of `async`

JavaScript is a single-threaded language, at any time only one chunk of code is being executed.

This has implications on Gauntlet plugins.

Let's say you have 2 entry points: view and entrypoint generator, let's also say that your generator entrypoint needs to scan some directories.
If you are using synchronous versions of functions to access file system, user will not be able to open any views
because JS runtime is being busy with scanning directories. For this reason prefer using async versions of APIs where possible,
or if your code is computationally intensive, offload the computation to a worker

## Examples

### Simple
TODO not dynamic

### Update based on file system events

### Accessories

### Icons

### View actions

### Preferences

### Actions

### Action shortcuts

TODO shortcut works when item is focused
